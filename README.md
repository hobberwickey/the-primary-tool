# Misson
This project has two intentions 
1. To make running for office easy and cheap by creating freely available set of tool for literally everything a campaign would need, and walking people through everything involved
1. To make all the information about candidates a voter would need available to voters in a centralized place, as well as other tools (registration links, volunteering, donating, asking questions of candidates, whatever else seems useful)


The [deployed version](https://d36n53dp4mkj1.cloudfront.net) lives here

## Getting started
1. Have a project admin add you to the project
1. Install the project & packages
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:hobberwickey/the-primary-tool.git
    cd the-primary-tool
    npm install
    ```
1. Run the project. Local instance should open in [a new tab](http://localhost:3000)
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Contributing
Still need to write this up, but I think the plan is to use branches, but not forks and do everything via pull requests. Need to check with the team.
